From [Wikipeda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OFX):

Open Financial Exchange (OFX) arising from Microsoft's OFC and Intuit's Open Exchange is a data-stream format for exchanging financial information.

The OFX standard was announced on the 16 January 1997 by Microsoft, Intuit and CheckFree and was designed as a unified technical specification to converge their respective mechanisms. Since the specification allows for bank and application specific extensions, few banks support OFX as a vendor-independent format, preferring to support a narrow subset used only by a specific financial software application, such as Quicken. To date, there are no publicly available and accurate lists of banks that fully support OFX.

Versions 1.0â€“1.6 relied on SGML for data exchange whereas all versions since rely on XML. OFX is protocol-independent but generally consists of CGI scripts contacted over TCP.
