# Details #

From Wikipedia:
"Most personal money management software (Microsoft Money, Intuit's Quicken versions earlier than 2006) can read QIF files to import information. However, Quicken has dropped support of QIF for online banking accounts as of version 2006. However, as of release [R4](https://code.google.com/p/fin-ally/source/detail?r=4), Quicken 2006 still supports importing and exporting transactions in QIF format for asset, liability, cash, small business payable, and invoice accounts. Banks that support integrated online banking (i.e. as part of Money or Quicken) usually use [OFX](http://code.google.com/p/fin-ally/wiki/OFX) instead of QIF."
