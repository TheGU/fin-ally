# Abstract: This is the Model/Controller component of the FINally SQLite finance tool.
# This file provides driver level functions for data manipulation that can be called
# by the FINally View component (Model-functionality). This file is also responsible
# for post processing and manipulating data before passing it back to the View
# (Controller-functionality).
